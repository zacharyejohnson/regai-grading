827,1,6.0,6.0,0.5,"{'name': 'Overall Quality', 'score': 3, 'justification': 'The student submission demonstrates a minimally-developed response that takes a position on the effects of computers, but with inadequate support and details. While the essay attempts to identify some potential benefits of computers, such as online communication, research, and e-commerce, the reasons provided are quite general and lack elaboration.\n\nFor example, the student states that computers allow people to ""interact with Your Family and friends either in @CAPS1 chat or @CAPS2"", but does not explain how this interaction is beneficial or how it compares to in-person interactions. Similarly, the claim that computers are ""helpful for applying for @CAPS3"" is vague and would be strengthened by providing specific examples of how computer skills or online job applications are advantageous.\n\nThe organization of the essay is somewhat basic, with an introductory assertion followed by related points. However, the transitions between ideas are minimal, and the overall structure lacks fluency. The writing also contains numerous grammatical and spelling errors that impede clarity at times.\n\nOverall, the submission meets the criteria for a score of 3 on the rubric. It takes a position on the effects of computers, but the support provided is inadequate, and the essay demonstrates only a minimal level of organization and audience awareness. While the student makes an attempt to engage with the prompt, the response lacks the development and persuasive elements needed for a higher score.'}"
1477,1,6.0,3.999999999999999,0.33333333333333326,"{'name': 'Overall Quality', 'score': 2, 'justification': ""The student's essay is under-developed and lacks a clear, persuasive position on the effects of computers. The response provides only general, list-like reasons without any elaboration or specific details. For example, the student states that computers can affect a person's 'eyes', 'body', and 'mind', but the explanations are vague and do not demonstrate a deeper understanding of the potential impacts.\n\nThe organization of the essay is poor, with ideas presented in a random, disjointed manner. Transitions between paragraphs are minimal and simplistic (e.g., 'First', 'Second', 'Third'). The writing is awkward and confusing in parts, with numerous grammatical and spelling errors that impede understanding.\n\nWhile the student attempts to address the prompt by discussing both positive and negative effects of computers, the response fails to show awareness of the target newspaper audience or make any real attempts to persuade the readers. The overall lack of development, organization, and audience awareness aligns the essay most closely with the criteria for a score of 2 on the rubric.""}"
234,1,8.0,7.999999999999998,0.6666666666666665,"{'name': 'Overall Quality', 'score': 4, 'justification': 'The essay takes a clear position that computers are beneficial, providing several reasons to support this view. The student discusses how computers allow for communication with family abroad, research on foreign countries, and use for school projects. These points are relevant to the prompt, demonstrating an understanding of both the potential positive and negative effects of computers. However, the elaboration and development of these ideas is somewhat limited, with the explanations lacking depth and specific details. For instance, the point about communicating with family abroad could be strengthened by explaining how this impacts relationships or reduces isolation. The organization of the essay is satisfactory, with an identifiable introduction, body, and conclusion, and some transitional language is used, although it feels somewhat mechanical at times. The letter format is mostly correct, showing awareness of the newspaper audience, but could be improved with a more tailored approach to persuade the readers. Overall, the essay meets the criteria for a somewhat-developed response that takes a clear position and provides adequate support, warranting a score of 4.'}"
801,1,9.0,3.999999999999999,0.33333333333333326,"{'name': 'Overall Quality', 'score': 2, 'justification': ""The student submission is an under-developed response that lacks a clear position on the effects of computers on society. The essay presents a mix of general reasons for both the positive and negative impacts of computers, but these points are not elaborated upon with specific details or examples. For instance, the student mentions how computers allow people to 'interact with new people', 'travel to new places', and 'learn new things', but does not explain the significance or provide concrete illustrations of these benefits. Similarly, the concerns raised about excessive computer use leading to missed experiences, weight gain, and health issues are stated broadly without substantiation. The organization of the essay is poor, with ideas presented in a disjointed, list-like manner without clear transitions between paragraphs. The writing is often awkward and simplistic, with numerous grammar and spelling errors that impede understanding in parts. While the student attempts to address the prompt by touching on some of the key points, the overall response lacks the coherence, elaboration, and awareness of audience required for a score above a 2 on the rubric.""}"
780,1,9.0,6.0,0.5,"{'name': 'Overall Quality', 'score': 3, 'justification': ""Upon further review, the student submission demonstrates a minimally-developed response that takes a clear position against the benefits of computers in society. While the support provided is limited in depth and elaboration, the essay does attempt to outline several relevant concerns, such as the negative impacts of computer use on physical health, mental wellbeing, and social interactions.\n\nSpecifically, the student cites a study indicating that excessive computer use can lead to weight gain and health issues, and provides a personal anecdote about a friend who gained weight after getting a computer. These examples, while lacking in specific details, do represent an effort to ground the argument in evidence. Additionally, the essay touches on how computer use can reduce time spent with family and friends, potentially leading to loneliness and depression.\n\nThe organization of the essay is somewhat disjointed, with ideas presented in a list-like manner without smooth transitions. The writing also contains numerous grammatical and spelling errors that detract from the clarity. However, the overall attempt to engage with the prompt and provide a reasoned position, even if minimally developed, warrants a score of 3 according to the rubric's criteria for a minimally-developed response.""}"
